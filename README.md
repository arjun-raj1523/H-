# HandsPlus
H+ is a student assistant application that lets you help a fellow student in times of need. For example, I need help moving a table from one place to another, instead of me waiting for a friend, I could just post a request in the Need Help section, anyone who is free and willing to help me could just Hi5 me and help me out. His reward could vary from a candy bar to money, depending upon the person requesting the help. The Need Help request could vary from a simple request to move things from one place to another to tutoring someone in learning an instrument. The second feature that we have decided to add is a Give Help section, where a person if he is good at a particular skill and is willing to help someone, could post an advertisement and people in need could contact him. This application would be used only by the students of IIT and would require an iit.edu id to login.
